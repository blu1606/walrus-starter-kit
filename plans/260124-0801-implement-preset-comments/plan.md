# Plan: Implement Coding Level Comments in Presets

## Status

- [x] Phase 1: Simple Upload Preset
- [x] Phase 2: Gallery Preset
- [x] Phase 3: Enoki Preset

## Overview

This plan aims to add educational comments to the `packages/cli/presets` directory. The comments will be tailored to a "Mid-Level" coding level (Level 2), focusing on explaining architectural decisions, patterns, and "why" things are done, rather than just "how".

## Goals

- Enhance readability of the starter kit templates.
- Explain Walrus SDK integration patterns.
- specific focus on `src/lib`, `src/hooks`, and `src/providers`.
